			<h2>Happening Now</h2>
			<h3><em>Roman Candle Summer</em></h3>
			<p>Bitsy is a high society woman who appears to have everything she could want - except a child. At a Junior League pool party hosted outside her home, Bitsy’s life collides with that of Tess, a fourteen-year-old girl bouncing around foster homes and selling fireworks on the state border. Through their unlikely friendship during a hot Alabama summer filled with carnivals and bottle-rockets, Tess and Bitsy learn from each other what it truly means to be part of a family. <em>Roman Candle Summer</em> is an often-humorous investigation into the definition of family and what it means to be wanted.</p>
			<p>As Found Stages' third annual production, this play will be performed as an immersive theatrical experience in and around a real swimming pool. The production will tour metro Atlanta in August through September, 2016. <a target="_blank" href="mailto:foundstagestheatre@gmail.com">Email us to suggest a location</a>!</p>
			<p><em>Roman Candle Summer</em> was a 2013 finalist of The Alliance Theatre Kendeda National Graduate Playwriting Competition. Staged readings have been held at The Alliance Theatre, LARK Play Development in New York City, and Working Title Playwrights’ Ethel Woolson Lab.</p>
