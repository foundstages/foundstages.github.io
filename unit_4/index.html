				<h2>News & Announcements</h2>
				<p>We like stories that give people a reason to get off the couch and leave the house. We like plays that aren’t complete till the audience gets there. We like artists who like the outdoors, coffee shops, warehouses, art galleries, and living rooms, and can imagine stories being told in those spaces. We like audiences who ask questions and take chances. We like shared meals and shared experiences. We like theatre that brings all these things together in one place.</p>
